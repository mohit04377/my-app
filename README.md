# React Native Demo App

This is a simple React Native app that demonstrates basic authentication and data fetching from an API. The app has two main screens: a login screen and a list of posts screen.

## Task 1: Login Screen

The login screen features:

- Username and password input fields
- "Login" button for authentication

Upon successful login, an alert displays "Login successful." Otherwise, an alert shows "Login failed."

## Task 2: Fetch and Display Data

The app fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API to display a list of posts. The list screen includes:

- A list of posts with titles and bodies
- Tapping on a post navigates to a details screen
- "Refresh" button updates the list of posts
